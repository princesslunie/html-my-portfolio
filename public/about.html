<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Momoh Princess. I'm a freelance UI/UX Designer and front-end web developer based in Nigeria. I have recently 
  completed the UX Designer Certificate Program with Entrylevel. I'm passionate about crafting experiences that are engaging, 
  accessible, and user-centric.</p>

<p>One thing that really excites me about design is being able to creating things with purpose and solve real life problems. 
  From sketching wireframes to making prototypes and building websites based on those design, its a really immersive experience 
  and one that i really enjoy.</p>

<p>When i'm not designing, I crochet, draw and write music. I love keeping my environment clean so you can also catch me 
  cleaning random things when I'm not working yarn, lol.</p>
